<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in an organic system are as damaging to human beings and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides.

Chemical controls were to be applied just after regular tracking suggested that a pest population had actually reached a level (the financial limit) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would exceed the cost of the control steps.</p>

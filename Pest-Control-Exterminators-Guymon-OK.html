<p>Due to the fact that crop production is highly precise due to modern-day innovations on one hand, as well as highly variable depending upon a myriad of biotic and abiotic factors and the proprietary practices of different farming operations, info management and decision-making parts play a critical function in IPM. Utilizing IPM to avoid pest problems and lessen reliance on pesticides is the best service for a healthy environment for everyone.</p>

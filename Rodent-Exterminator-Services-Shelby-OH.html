Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a holistic method to sustainable crop security that concentrates on managing insects, weeds and illness through a combination of cultural, physical, chemical and biological techniques that are cost reliable, ecologically sound and socially acceptable.</p>
<p>We historically have offered nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the effectiveness of ecologically unsound methods in addition to its selection of intrinsic strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, strains of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thereby increasing the possibility that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>

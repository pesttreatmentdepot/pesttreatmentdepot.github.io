<p>Termites consume furniture, documents, books, and even files kept in safes and lockers, thus triggering enormous damage within just a couple of months.

<p>Biological pest control steps take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial task is to establish appropriate pest levels, called action thresholds, and use controls where the limits are crossed. Understanding of these limits and characteristics of pests and natural opponents helps to prevent unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even repair structural damage brought on by termites.</p>

Expert exterminators use various types of baits and pesticides to kill and eliminate pests. Effective, permanent corrective actions can then be required to avoid pests from entering the structure and infesting the building and collections. </p>

CHEMICAL CONTROL OF INSECT PEST: Use of artificial chemicals for handling pest population is called chemical control and the chemicals used for this are called insecticides.</p>
<p>Biological pest control measures take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs preliminary task is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action thresholds, and use controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these thresholds and characteristics of pests and natural opponents assists to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even repair structural damage triggered by termites.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production uses many of the same principles as IPM however restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to reduce the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides. </p>

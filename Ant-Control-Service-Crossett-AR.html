<h3>Care Pest Control Crossett AR 71635</h3>
<p>Consider alternative techniques (other than pesticides) to make your house and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a building. Current quests for effective, safe, and enduring pest management programs have actually been targeted primarily towards development of new and better products with which to change standard harmful pesticides.</p>
<p>IPM methods consist of both chemical and nonchemical ways to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest effective dose when other approaches of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that concentrates on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, habitat adjustment, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>

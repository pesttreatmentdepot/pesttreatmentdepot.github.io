Examination is typically among the most essential actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the process of examining an IPM program and the results it has generated.</p>
<p>For some jobs, pest control workers utilize a mix of pest management techniques, a practice known as incorporated pest management. The foundation of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of regular inspections. Crop losses due to illness, weeds, and arthropods, though disputed by some as a valid step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the intensification of pest control.</p>
